# SSEM Display

SSEM computer used CRT "display", which displayed the SSEM memory content. emuStudio plugin does not mimic the real display interface with switches and everything, but it is just a display of the memory content. [Here][crt]{:target="_blank"} can be seen how the original display looked like.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

GUI of the display looks as follows:

![SSEM Display GUI sample look]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ssem/ssem-display.png)

It doesn't do any user interaction except displaying.
