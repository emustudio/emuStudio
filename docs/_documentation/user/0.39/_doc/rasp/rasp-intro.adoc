== Brief description

Random Access Stored Program machine (RASP) is an abstract von-Neumann computer. It means it does not represent a physical device,
but ranther it is intended to work as a model to study von-Neumann architecture, without the need to care about specific manufacturer's 
hardware details. 

Firstly, it is usefull to present Random Access Stored Program (RASP) machine's architecture -- it is schematically depicted in the following figure.

As we can see, the control unit, i.e. processor, reads data from the input tape and writes results of executed operations onto the output tape. 
The tapes serve as a form of I/O devices. The two heads -- reading (R) and writing (W), are pointers to current reading/writing position. 

As already stated, RASP machine represents a von Neumann computer. 
This implies that the operating memory exists as a single unit in which both program and data can reside. 
The segment containing the program is organised in the way that two adjacent cells contain instruction/operand alternately. 
The memory can be read as well as written to by the control unit.  

== Installation and run

There is no need to download/install RASP separately as it is included in the emuStudio distribution. Here is the structure of the directories
containing the files neccessary for our RASP virtual computer:

=== Directory structure

- `config/RASP.conf`: configuration file of RASP architecture.
- `compilers/raspc-rasp.jar`: RASP compiler plug-in.
- `cpu/rasp-cpu.jar`: RASP CPU emulator - CPU plug-in.
- `mem/rasp-mem.jar`: RASP main memory plug-in.

RASP virtual computer in emuStudio uses with tapes as I/O devices. For this purpose, `abstractTape-ram.jar` plug-in is used ((C) P. Jakubƒço).

=== Abstract schema

Each virtual computer in emuStudio is defined by so called 'abstract schema' (please see emuStudio User documentation).
It defines all the parts of its architecture (what it consists of) and inner communication (how architecture components are interconnected).
Following figure presents RASP abstact schema:
