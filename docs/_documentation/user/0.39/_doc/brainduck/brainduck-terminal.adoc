- blinking cursor simulation
- keyboard input; binary codes can be entered with special dialog
- terminal interprets some special characters like 0x8 (backspace), 0x9 (tab), 0xA (LF), and 0x10 (CR)

It's easy and simple. BrainDuck CPU as it interprets `.` (dot) instructions, it sends the output to this terminal and it is
displayed on screen.

Input cannot be entered anytime. In brainfuck, input is requested through `,` instruction. Only when CPU encounters
`,` (comma) instruction, user is asked to enter input. This situation is marked with geen icon in the bottom-left corner:

Next to the icon, there is a blue "ASC" button. This button can be used for entering binary values as input.
Special little dialog will appear asking user to enter space-separated numbers, representing ASCII codes of the input.

NOTE: The terminal do not display characters with ASCII codes less than 32. Only some special characters are interpreted:
0x8 (backspace), 0x9 (tab), 0xA (LF), and 0x10 (CR)
