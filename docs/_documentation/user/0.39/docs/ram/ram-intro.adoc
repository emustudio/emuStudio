== Introduction

Random Access Machine (RAM) is an abstract machine, invented to study algorithmic complexity of programs written
on register-based computers. It is equivalent to Turing machine, and has a close relationship with a so-called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture[Harvard computer architecture], which has separated storage for
program and data. The implication of this model is that it is not possible to modify instructions.

NOTE: In contrast, there exist a Random Access Stored Program machine (RASP), which is close to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture[von-Neumann computer architecture].

Both RAM and RASP are implemented as emulators, or maybe better - simulators in emuStudio. This documents describes
the RAM simulator.

== Brief description

RAM machine consists of several parts: input tape (read-only), output tape (write-only), program memory,
data memory or registers (read/write) and a control unit ("engine"), as can be seen in the following image:

Input tape acts as a water-tap; the input data can be read from it, causing the input head moving to the next unread
symbol. The head can never return to previously read symbol.

Output tape, on the other hand, acts as a sink. The output data can be written to it, causing the output head moving
to the next "empty" symbol. The head can also never return to the previously written symbol.

Data memory - registers tape - represents the random-access memory. It consists of so-called registers, abstract cells
with arbitrary size. These registers are ordered - each one has assigned the index - its position within the tape, called
the _address_. The tape head can move arbitrarily up and down - but it has its minimum position. It is
the first register, _R~0~_, called the accumulator. Below there are unlimited number of higher-positioned registers.

The role of accumulator is kind of special - it often acts as an implicit operand for many instructions, or implicit
place for storing the result of such instructions.

Program memory is a bounded ordered sequence of registers; each of them is identified by its index within the tape,
called address. Data memory is also ordered sequence of registers, but like the I/O tapes - bounded just from one side.

Since RAM machine is somewhat abstract, it frees the user from thinking about some issues, and just assumes that:

- The size of the problem is always small enough to fit in the RAM memory,
- Data used within the computation are always small enough to fit in one register.

The RAM virtual machine in emuStudio consists of the following plug-ins:

- `ramc-ram`: Compiler of the RAM language, very simple "assembler"-like language
- `ram-cpu`: RAM simulator engine
- `ram-mem`: Program memory
- `abstractTape-ram`: Device which represents the "tape" used in RAM, other than program memory. The abstract schema
                      must define three instances of this device, representing register, input and output tapes.

=== Abstract schema

In order to use RAM, there must exist the abstract schema of the "computer", saved in the configuration
file. Abstract schemas are drawn in the schema editor in emuStudio (please see emuStudio main module
documentation for more details). The following image shows the schema of RAM machine simulator:

image::{imagepath}/ram-schema.png[RAM abstract schema]

The "->" arrows are in direction of dependency. So for example `ramc-ram` depends on
`ram-mem`, because compiled programs are directly loaded into memory.

The roles of the abstract tapes are assigned by the RAM "CPU" on runtime.

=== Automatic emulation

RAM is one of computers which supports automatic emulation. In general, automatic emulation can be interactive,
or not interactive. In case of the RAM emulator, only non-interactive emulation is useful. It is because during emulation
it is not possible to interact (e.g. pass new input to the input tape) in any way.

Changes to any abstract tapes are written to the corresponding output file. For more specific information,
please see <<ABSTRACT_TAPE_AUTOMATIC_EMULATION>> section of the abstract tape chapter.

Command line for starting non-interactive automatic emulation:

    java -jar emuStudio.jar --config RAM --input examples/ramc-ram/factorial.ram --auto --nogui

- configuration `config/RAM.conf` will be loaded
- input file for compiler is one of the examples
- (`--auto`) automatic emulation mode will be performed
- (`--nogui`) non-interactive version will be set

After the run, the following output on the stdout can be expected:

----

Then, in the current working directory, there will be created three new files:

- `input_tape.out`
- `registers_(storage_tape).out`
- `output_tape.out`

The format of the files is described in already mentioned <<ABSTRACT_TAPE_AUTOMATIC_EMULATION>> section of the
abstract tape chapter.
