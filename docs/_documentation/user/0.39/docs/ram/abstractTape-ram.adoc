[[ABSTRRACT_TAPE]]
== Abstract tapes

Abstract tapes, in general, are used in various abstract machines. Probably the best known are Turing machine,
RAM machine and RASP machine. Plug-in of the abstract tape for emuStudio is called `abstractTape-ram`.

There are several properties which an abstract tape might have:

- Bounded, one-side bounded or unbounded
- Random access (allowing to move head in both directions) or linear access (allowing to move head only in one direction)
- Specific or any cell content type (e.g. cells are integers, or strings, or can be any value?)
- Read only, or read-write cells
- Purpose of the tape (title)

This plug-in allows to set up such properties, but those are set up by the virtual computer which uses it, not by
the user. For more information, please see the <<ABSTRRACT_TAPE_PROGRAMMING>> section.

Currently, there are just two virtual computers utilizing this plug-in:

- RAM machine
- RASP machine

After emuStudio is run, RAM CPU (or RASP CPU) sets up properties for all used tapes. So the tape "purpose" and behavior
is set in run time.

=== Installation and run

The abstract tape can be run only as a part of emuStudio. It is installed in location `devices/abstractTape-ram.jar`.

=== Graphical user interface (GUI)

The graphical user interface of the abstract tape is very simple. In order to open it, select the tape in the
peripheral devices list in the Emulator panel. Then, click on the "Show" button.

The symbol, highlighted with the blue color is the current head position, in this case. In order to manipulate with
particular symbols, one must _select_ the symbol, which appears in *bold*, as in the following image:

image::{imagepath}/abstractTape-ram-selection.png[Selected symbol in the abstract tape]

- *A*: If the tape allows it, one can add new symbol before the selected one in the tape. In the image, the tape does
       not allow it.
- *B*: The tape content area. Usually, each row consists of the symbol "index" or position within the tape, followed
       by the symbol itself.
- *C*: If the tape allows it, one can add new symbol after the last one in the tape. In the image, the tape allows it.
- *D*: Removes selected symbol from the tape.
- *E*: Edits the tape symbol. The symbol must be selected.
- *F*: Clears the tape content

==== Settings

The tape allows to edit some settings from the graphical mode; to open the settings window click on the "Settings"
button below the peripheral devices list in the Emulator panel. The window can be seen in the following image:

image::{imagepath}/abstractTape-ram-settings.png[Abstract tape settings]

- *A*: Do not allow the tape to fall behind other window
- *B*: Show the tape right after emuStudio start (see <<ABSTRACT_TAPE_CONFIG_FILE>> section)


[[ABSTRACT_TAPE_CONFIG_FILE]]
=== Configuration file

Configuration file of virtual computers contain also settings of all the used plug-ins, including devices. Please
read the section "Accessing settings of plug-ins" in the user documentation of Main module to see how the settings can
be accessed.

The following table shows all the possible settings of Abstract tape plug-in:

.Settings of Abstract tape
[frame="topbot",options="header,footer",role="table table-striped table-condensed"]
|=====================================================================================================
|Name              | Default value        | Valid values          | Description
|`showAtStartup`   | false                | true, false           | If the tape should be shown automatically
                                                                    after emuStudio is started
|`alwaysOnTop`     | false                | true, false           | Whether the tape GUI should not allow to fall
                                                                    behind other windows
|=====================================================================================================


[[ABSTRACT_TAPE_AUTOMATIC_EMULATION]]
=== Automatic emulation

Abstract tape supports automatic emulation. It means, that every change to it is being written to a file. The file
name is devised from the title of the tape, by the following algorithm:

- At first, all spaces in the title are replaced with underscore (`_`)
- Then, all "unwanted" characters are also replaced with underscore
- Every character is converted to lower-case
- Finally, the `.out` extension is added at the end.

Unwanted characters are the following: `*`, `.`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `+`, `!`, `~`, `/`, `?`, `<`, `>`, `,`, `|`, `{`, `}`,
                               `[`, `]`, `"`, ```, `=`

=== Using abstract tapes in your emulator

NOTE: This section is for developers of emulators. If you do not plan to create custom virtual computers,
      you can safely skip this section. In order to get started with developing plug-ins for emuStudio,
      please read tutorial "Developing emuStudio Plugins".

The Abstract tape plug-in can be used in various computers. Besides standard operations which are provided by
`emulib.plugins.device.DeviceContext` interface, it provides custom context API, enabling to setting up properties
described in the <<ABSTRRACT_TAPE, introduction>> section.

Usually, the tapes are used by CPU plug-ins, but it is ofcourse possible to use it in any other plug-in.
You can obtain the context during the `initialize()` method of the plug-in main class. The context is named
`net.sf.net.emustudio.devices.abstracttape.api.AbstractTapeContext`:

[source,java]
----
...

public void initialize(SettingsManager settings) {
    ...

    AbstractTapeContext tape = contextPoolImpl.getDeviceContext(pluginID, AbstractTapeContext.class);
    ...
}
----

The tape context interface is as follows:

[source,java]

package net.sf.emustudio.devices.abstracttape.api;
