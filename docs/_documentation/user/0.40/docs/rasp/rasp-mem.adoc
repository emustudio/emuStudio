== Memory `rasp-mem`

RASP memory plug-in serves as the main store (operating memory) for the RASP virtual computer. As already mentioned in the introduction
of this manual, RASP is an example of von-Neumann architecture, which implies that both program and data reside in the same memory module.

After compilation of a RASP source code file the compiled program is loaded into here. During the process of the emulation, the CPU plug-in
reads instructions an their operands and writes results of the operations from/to the memory. 

=== Installation and run

RASP memory plugin is already included in emuStudio distribution, in location `mem/rasp-mem.jar`.

=== Graphical user interface (GUI)

During the emulation, user can view current content of the operating memory in a simple GUI window:

image::{imagepath}/memory_window.png[Memory GUI window]

It is also possible to load a compiled memory image 
from a file by clicking on the OPEN icon:

image::{imagepath}/document-open.png[OPEN icon]

After that, you can choose the binary file you want to load.

By clicking on the CLEAN icon, you can clean the entire memory content:

image::{imagepath}/edit-delete.png[CLEAN icon]

The table with memory cells content is editable. By double-clicking on a row you can simply edit the value. You confirm your changes by 
the ENTER key. 
 

WARNING: If you edit a cell that contains an instruction, you edit its operation code, e.g. if a cell contains the `ADD =` instruction (operation code 7)
and you change the cell to 9, the operation code will be overwritten. As a result, the instruction changes to `SUB =`. It means that you cannot 
write number 9 as a data item here, only as an operation code.
