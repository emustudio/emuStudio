== CPU "brainduck-cpu"

BrainDuck CPU is used as a part of BrainDuck computer, which acts as the interpreter of BrainDuck
instructions. Those instructions correspond with brainfuck language.

Program which is going to be executed is read from the operating memory, so the CPU must be
connected with memory (`brainduck-mem`), in order to work properly.

Also, optionally (but commonly) it is should be connected with I/O device (`brainduck-terminal`),
so input/output can be received/send from/to the device. Only one device can be used.

The CPU provides basic user interface in the form of status panel, which is visible in the emulator
panel in the main window.

Breakpoints are supported, so as "jump" to specific location, which might be actually dangerous to use.

=== Installation and run

The BrainDuck CPU can be run only as a part of emuStudio. It is installed in location `cpu/brainduck-cpu.jar`.

=== Status panel

In the following image, you can see the status panel of `brainduck-cpu`.

It is split into three parts. Within 'Internal status' part, there is shown content of registers `IP` and `P`. Register
`IP` does not have counterpart in brainfuck. IP stands for "instruction pointer". The content is pointing at the next
instruction being executed. Register `P` is commonly known from brainfuck. It is pointer to data.

There is measured execution time, which is reset when user starts the program and stopped when either the program stops
or the user stops it.

Loop level shows the depth level of brainfuck loop the program is in. For example, if instruction pointer points
into middle of the program `[[-]]`, to the `-` instruction, loop level is 2.

=== Running brainfuck programs

It is very important to reset CPU after each source code compilation. The reason is that after compilation register
`P` is not changed. It therefore might point somewhere into compiled code in the memory. If the program was executed,
changes in data would corrupt the program itself.

Resetting CPU would move the `P` register after first occurrence of memory cell with value `0`. The value `0` in
BrainDuck CPU represents halt instruction, which corresponds to EOF in brainfuck.
