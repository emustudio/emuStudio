== Compiler "brainc-brainduck"

BrainDuck compiler is used as a part of BrainDuck computer, which acts as a translator of *brainfuck* "human-readable"
language into binary form, used by BrainDuck CPU. Those instructions and their binary codes have no relation
with brainfuck itself, therefore the computer is not called *brainfuck computer*, because it is **not** brainfuck.
But it does not mean you cannot write and run brainfuck programs in it :)

At first, each compiler, including BrainDuck compiler, provides lexical analyzer for help with tokenize of the source
code, used in syntax highlighting. Secondly, the compile *compiles* the source code into other (usually binary) form
which is then understood by CPU.

Compilation takes part by user request (clicking on 'compile' icon in the main window). After compilation is successful,
the compiler usually loads the translated program into operating memory, and saves the translation into a file. So it
is with BrainDuck compiler. Files have `.hex` extension.footnote:[Intel HEX format, for more info see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX]

=== Installation and run

The compiler is provided as part of emuStudio. It is not deployed as individual package. The compiler can be found
in `compilers/` directory with name `brainc-brainduck.jar`.

The compiler can be run from command line, with command:

    java -jar brainc-brainduck.jar [--output output_file.hex] [source_file.b]

To query for more information, run the compiler with command:

    java -jar brainc-brainduck.jar --help

Using compiler in command line might be useful for emulation automation.

=== Language Syntax

The language of BrainDuck compiler is almost identical with the original brainfuck. However, brainfuck interpreter is
not specified well-enough, so there are open questions how to treat with some special situations, which are described
below.

Generally, the language knows eight instructions. They are best described when they are compared with C language
equivalent. Brainfuck uses only single data pointer called `P`, pointing to bounded memory.footnote:[The boundary is
specified in `brainduck-mem` plug-in]

NOTE: BrainDuck architecture conforms to true von-Neumann model, instead of classic Harvard-style interpreters.
It means that program memory and data memory are not separated. The data pointer is therefore not initialized
to 0 as programmers might expect and potentially there can be written brainfuck programs with self-modifications.

|================================================
|Brainfuck  instruction  | C language equivalent
| `>`                    | `P++`
| `<`                    | `P--`
| `+`                    | `++*P`
| `-`                    | `--*P`
| `,`                    | `*P = getchar()`
| `.`                    | `putchar(*P);`
| `[`                    | `while (*P) {`
| `]`                    | `}`
|================================================


The compiler is supplied with many example programms written in brainfuck.

=== Additional details

As was said before, specification of brainfuck language or interpreter implementation is not complete. There are left
some details which might be solved differently in different implementations. In this version of BrainDuck implementation
in emuStudio, the details are solved in the fixed way, as described below.

[[XCDC]]
==== Comments

The compiler takes as a comment everything which is not the brainfuck instruction. From the first occurence of
unknown character, everything to the end of the line is treated as comment. Exceptions are whitespaces, tabulators, and
newlines.footnote:[This practically means that it is impossible to write brainfuck program with syntax errors.]

In the following example, everything starting with `#` is treated as comment, up to end of the line.

    ++++[-] # Useless program in brainfuck. [-] clears the content of the memory cell.

[[XCDS]]
==== Cell size

The memory cells are of 8-bit size (cells are bytes).

[[XCDS]]
==== Memory size

The memory size is defined in `brainduck-mem` plug-in. In this version of emuStudio, it is 65536 cells.

[[XCDE]]
==== End-of-line code

EOL is defined in `brainduck-terminal` plug-in. In the current version of emuStudio, it is a Newline character with
ASCII code 10.


[[XCDF]]
==== End-of-file behavior

EOF is defined in `brainduck-cpu` and `brainduck-terminal` plug-ins. In the current version of emuStudio, current
cell (where `P` is pointing at) is changed to value 0.footnote:[This is not how original brainfuck behaves, which
is doing no change to the cell on EOF]
