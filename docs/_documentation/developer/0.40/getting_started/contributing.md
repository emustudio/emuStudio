# How to contribute

There are basically two options how to contribute. Either you fix or enhance the application or plugins, or
you implement completely new computer which can be used with emuStudio. The latter does not really mean to contribute,
unless it is included in the original emuStudio repository.

Each contribution "topic" should have a separate issue on GitHub, where can be held discussions. Contributors
should fork the repository, and derive their feature branches from `development` branch. 

When you are satisfied with your work, make a [pull request][pull-requests]{:target="_blank"} to
the main repository, into branch `development`. Then, some reviewer will take a look on the PR, and can suggest some
changes, or will merge it.

Commit messages should be in the form of:

```
[#XXX] Description of commit
``` 

where `#XXX` represents the issue number. Then, the commit will be shown as a comment in the issue and can be properly
tracked.

## Code style

Code should be "clean", in terms of sticking to various good practices and principles (e.g. [SOLID][solid]{:target="_blank"}, [GRASP][grasp]{:target="_blank"}, [YAGNI][yagni]{:target="_blank"}, [KISS][kiss]{:target="_blank"}, [DRY][dry]{:target="_blank"}, etc.).

Code use 4 spaces.

## Definition of DONE

There are some requirements which need to be fulfilled before we can say that the contribution is "done" and can be
accepted or released. The list is very simple:

- Code should be clean, conforming to the code style
- Code must have proper unit tests, if applicable or possible
- Documentation should be updated
