is the core part of emuStudio application. Users usually spends there most of the time while working with emuStudio.</p> <p>The content of the window is split into two panels or tabs, placeholders for two actions users can do in emuStudio. The first tab is “Source code editor”, second is “Emulator”, used during computer emulation.</p> <h2 id="source-code-editor"> <a href="#source-code-editor" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Source code editor </h2> <p><img src="/documentation/user/0.40/application/images/source-code.png" alt="Source code tab" /></p> <p>In the source code editor, users can write programs for emulated computer. However, the most important tool which allows translation of the source code into binary program readable by emulated CPU is a compiler. Therefore, users must use the right compiler.</p> <p>Input language of a compiler is not limited, it can be either a kind of assembler, or even C or Pascal language. It depends on the compiler implementation, there can be many. The only restriction is that compiler must have output which is compatible with CPU which is currently being emulated. This cannot be checked automatically, users must take care of this.</p> <p>Source code editor supports only the basic features, such as line numbering and syntax highlighting. Also, there is possibility to search/replace text.</p> <p>Compilation must be run manually. Compiler output window shows all messages which compiler produces. The content is dependant on the used compiler, but most likely it will contain compilation success or errors messages.</p> <p>Compiled source code can produce output binary file (for example a HEX file), and it’s automatically loaded into the operating memory. If the emulation is running, user must stop it first manually.</p> <p>If another program is loaded in memory, it is not removed before loading currently compiled program, but the memory is overwritten at only those locations relevant to the compiled program. All the other content is left unchanged.</p> <h2 id="emulator-tab"> <a href="#emulator-tab" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Emulator tab </h2> <p><em>Emulator tab</em> is shown in the following image. It is currently open with MITS Altair8800 computer with Intel 8080 CPU, and several devices:</p> <p><img src="/documentation/user/0.40/application/images/emulator.png" alt="Emulator tab" /></p> <p>The tab contains three main parts. The first one is very useful - listing of operating memory, disassembled into instructions. This part is called a debugger window, or “debugger”. The other part, below the debugger window is a list of all computer devices used (“peripheral devices”). With a double-click user can open GUI window of that particular device, if it supports it.</p> <p>The last part on the right displays status of the CPU used in this computer. Each CPU has its own implementation of how the status window look and what it displays.</p> <h3 id="debugger-window"> <a href="#debugger-window" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Debugger window </h3> <p>Debugging is a process in which a programmer tries to analyze a program, usually with the intent to find bugs. The adverb “to debug” has a deep history. Very early computers were having of so-called vacuum tubes, which were core elements acting as electrically controlled switches. From time to time a computer stopped working, and the most usual reason was that a bug (real one) came in a vacuum tube. Maintainers of the computer had to go there and manually remove the bug. It happened that often, so that the process of removing bugs got a name - “to de-bug”.] Debugger in emuStudio contains a debugger toolbar and list of few disassembled instructions from memory. In combination with CPU status panel, it’s the most powerful tool for seeing (and checking) all internal behavior of the emulated computer.</p> <h4 id="debugger-toolbar"> <a href="#debugger-toolbar" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Debugger toolbar </h4> <p>Debugger toolbar contains buttons (icons) for controlling the emulation and accessing memory content. Most of these buttons are self-explanatory. If you hover over those icons, a help text is displayed of how to use the icon.</p> <p><img src="/documentation/user/0.40/application/images/debugger-toolbar.png" alt="Debugger toolbar" /></p> <ul> <li><em>A</em>: Reset emulation.</li> <li><em>B</em>: Set next instruction position to 0. CPU will perform the next instruction from there.</li> <li><em>C</em>: Set next instruction position to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(current - 1)</code>. This action can completely change displaying of instructions, since the new instruction position does not have to be correct in term of executing the current program.</li> <li><em>D</em>: Stop emulation (which is either running or paused).</li> <li><em>E</em>: Pause emulation (which is running).</li> <li><em>F</em>: Run emulation (which is paused).</li> <li><em>G</em>: Run emulation with timer (which is paused). Instructions are executed after elapsing specified time interval. A dialog will appear to enter the time interval.</li> <li><em>H</em>: Step emulation (which is paused). CPU will execute only one - the very next - instruction.</li> <li><em>I</em>: Jump to location. User will manually specify location (address in memory) for the next instruction to execute.</li> <li><em>J</em>: Set/unset breakpoint. User can set or unset a breakpoint on specific memory location. When CPU reaches the breakpoint, it will pause there, waiting for next user action.</li> <li><em>K</em>: Show operating memory. If the memory plug-in does not have a GUI, the icon is disabled.</li> </ul> <h4 id="list-of-instructions"> <a href="#list-of-instructions" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> List of instructions </h4> <p>The largest part of the debugger window a list of few disassembled instructions, so-called <em>instructions window</em>. Around 15 instructions are shown, but it depends on the CPU. They are arranged in a table. The first column is usually interactive, allowing user to set breakpoints. Red strip is pointing to the very next instruction being executed.</p> <p>The size of disassembled memory (resulting in the number of disassembled instructions) is not configurable. Also, user cannot change instructions in this place.</p> <p>Sometimes the instructions shown in the debugger do not have to be disassembled correctly. There are two reasons for that:</p> <ul> <li>first, instructions can have various binary sizes (e.g. one byte, two bytes, etc.)</li> <li>second, memory can contain programs on various locations, and emuStudio doesn’t know where. Well, if it’s just program compiled from the source code editor, it knows.</li> </ul> <p>The implication is that if emuStudio starts to disassemble instructions at wrong location, the instructions will be disassembled incorrectly, or they can appear as invalid.</p> <p>However, emuStudio is trying hard to find the nearest program start location at which it’s safe to start disassembling. Usually it’s just few instructions back, so it is a fast process.</p> <h4 id="controlling-of-displaying-the-instructions"> <a href="#controlling-of-displaying-the-instructions" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Controlling of displaying the instructions </h4> <p>It’s possible to change the current instructions view. The window can be moved in a per-page fashion. The amount of instructions displayed in the window is always preserved. With the toolbar below the list it’s possible to change “pages” of the displayed instructions.</p> <p><img src="/documentation/user/0.40/application/images/instructions-panel.png" alt="Controlling instructions window" /></p> <ul> <li><em>A</em>: Go to the first page. The very first row corresponds to instruction position 0.</li> <li><em>B</em>: Go backwards. User will specify the number of pages for going back.</li> <li><em>C</em>: Go to the previous page.</li> <li><em>D</em>: Go to the page where current instruction position is.</li> <li><em>E</em>: Go to the next page.</li> <li><em>F</em>: Go forwards. User will specify the number of pages for going forward.</li> <li><em>G</em>: Go to the last page. It can cause incorrectly displaying of instructions.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
