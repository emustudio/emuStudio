## History

Project 'emuStudio' started in 2006 as a school project, then a master thesis, created by [Peter Jakubčo][peterj]{:target="_blank"}. He had continued to work on it afterwards, giving it less and less spare time he has now.

Supervisor of the school project was [Slavomír Šimoňák][slavos]{:target="_blank"}, who could be understood as the first "product owner". On a personal note, the original author remembers the times with nostalgy. Lots of good ideas came from discussions between the supervisor and the author.

The main reason why the project started was lack of good but simple emulators which allowed 'program-load-emulate' workflow. Back then at [Technical University of Košice][tuke]{:target="_blank"} ([Slovakia][tukesk]{:target="_blank"}), during first lessons in assembly language, students were at first introduced to vintage computers. They had to create simple programs for Intel 8080, but they did it by hand on a paper. emuStudio allowed to use computer, and since then it has established as basic tool, extending to multiple programming-like courses at the university.

Now, students are main contributors which extend emuStudio, but from time-to-time some unknown contributors appear as well, from various countries over the world. Original author still keeps maintaining it.

## Getting the support

If you are seeking for help with emuStudio, you have two options. Preferred way is to raise
an [issue](https://github.com/emustudio/emuStudio/issues).
The second option is to write an email to [developers group](mailto:emustudio@googlegroups.com).

Responses to the issues/emails might be slow, as this project is still mostly a one-person show, and it's a hobby.
Thank you for understanding.
