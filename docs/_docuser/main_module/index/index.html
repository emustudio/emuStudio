                            it provides Java API and documentation which encourages to implement any custom

                            Implementation language is Java SE 8, which makes emuStudio a naturally cross-platform
                            application.

                    <a href="#_footnoteref_6">6</a>. The adverb "to debug" has a deep history. Very early computers were
                    having of so-called vacuum tubes, which were core elements acting as electrically controlled
                    switches. From time to time a computer stopped working, and the most usual reason was that a bug
                    (real one) came in a vacuum tube. Maintainers of the computer had to go there and manually remove
                    the bug. It happened that often, so that the process of removing bugs got a name - "to de-bug".
