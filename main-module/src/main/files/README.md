# Welcome to emuStudio

emuStudio is a desktop application which allows to write programs and emulate computers.
In addition, it is easily extensible - acting as a framework it encourages developers to write their computer emulators.
It is versatile, free, and written in Java.

The main goal is to support learning about older but important computers or abstract machines.
I think it is also appropriate for schools; for example, emuStudio is used at
[Technical University of Ko≈°ice](http://www.fei.tuke.sk/en) since 2007.
