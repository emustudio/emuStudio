# Welcome to emuStudio

[emuStudio](https://www.emustudio.net/) is a desktop application used for computers emulation and writing programs
for emulated computers. It extensible; it encourages developers to write their own computer emulators.

The main goal of emuStudio is to support learning about older but important computers, or abstract machines, while
having fun. Nowadays, the ability to write programs for old computers is probably not quite interesting for the market,
but I guess emulation has always been more about fun, trying to keep alive something which was outstanding
in its peak, and preserve memories.

emuStudio is very appropriate for using at schools, e.g. when students are doing first steps in assembler, or when they
are taught about computers history. For example, emuStudio is used
at [Technical University of Košice](http://www.fei.tuke.sk/en)
since 2007.
