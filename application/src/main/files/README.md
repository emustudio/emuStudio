# Welcome to emuStudio

[emuStudio](https://www.emustudio.net/) is a desktop application used for computers emulation and writing programs
for emulated computers. It extensible; it encourages developers to write their own computer emulators.

Main goal of emuStudio is support learning about older but important computers, or abstract machines, while
having fun. Nowadays the ability to write programs for old computers is probably not quite interesting for the market,
but I guess emulation has always be more about fun, trying to keeping alive something which was outstanding
in it's peak, and preserve memories.

emuStudio is very appropriate for using at schools, e.g. when students are doing first steps in assembler, or when they
are taught about computers history. For example, emuStudio is used at [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](http://www.fei.tuke.sk/en)
since 2007.
