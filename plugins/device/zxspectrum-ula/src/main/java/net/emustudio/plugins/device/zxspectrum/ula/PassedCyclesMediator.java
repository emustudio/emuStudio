/**
 * Triggers actions based on passed CPU cycles.
 * <p>
 * For <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/48kreference.htm">ZX Spectrum 48K</a> the actions are:
 * <p>
 * - 0: CPU interrupt
 * - 0 - 14336: first 64 lines. From those, at least 48 are border-lines, others are either border or vertical retraces
 * After an interrupt occurs, 64 line times (14336 T states; see below for exact timings) pass before
 * - 14337 - 57344: 192 screen lines are displayed
 * - 57345 - 69888: 56 border-lines are displayed
 * <p>
 * This means a frame is (64+192+56)*224=69888 T states long, which means that the CPU interrupt occurs
 * at 3.5MHz/69888=50.08 Hz.
