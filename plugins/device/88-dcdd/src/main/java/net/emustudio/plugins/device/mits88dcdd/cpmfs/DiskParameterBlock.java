     * there are therefore 35 'Logical tracks' on each side of a disk, and 70 'Logical Tracks' on the disk as a whole.
     * The capacity of a disk is therefore
     * 128 * 16 * 70 = 143,360 Bytes ( 140K ).

     * But in M-T's '35-track' CP/M 2.2 for the MZ-80B a 'Logical Track' extends over BOTH sides of a disk; there are
     * therefore 35 'Logical Tracks' on the whole of a disk, and the disk capacity is
     * 128 * 80 * 35 = 358,400 ( 350K ).
