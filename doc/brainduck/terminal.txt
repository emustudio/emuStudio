It's easy and simple. BrainDuck CPU as it interprets `.` (dot) instructions, it sends the output to this terminal and it is
displayed on screen.

Input cannot be entered anytime. In brainfuck, input is requested through `,` instruction. Only when CPU encounters
`,` (comma) instruction, user is asked to enter input. This situation is marked with geen icon in the bottom-left corner:

Next to the icon, there is a blue "ASC" button. This button can be used for entering binary values as input.
Special little dialog will appear asking user to enter space-separated numbers, representing ASCII codes of the input.

      0x8 (backspace), 0x9 (tab), 0xA (LF), and 0x10 (CR)
