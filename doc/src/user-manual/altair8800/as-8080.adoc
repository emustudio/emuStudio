Assembler for Intel 8080 CPU in emuStudio is very similar to
http://altairclone.com/downloads/manuals/8080%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf[Intel assembler], but has some little
differences. Features include:

- full instructions support
- macro support (unlimited nesting)
- include other files support
- data definition
- relative addressing using labels
- literals and expressions in various radixes (bin, dec, hex, oct)
- output is in Intel HEX format only
