== Program Memory

RAM memory is used as a part of RAM simulator, which acts as the "program memory", holding just the program.

RAM CPU reads instructions from this memory. The instructions can be written here only by compiling
the source code, or loading already compiled binary image.

The memory plug-in contains simple graphical window, a GUI, which provides a set of the following features:

- It computes time and space complexity of the program
- It shows the memory content (the "program") as the list of disassembled instructions
