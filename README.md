# Welcome to emuStudio
![emuStudio Build](https://github.com/net.emustudio/emuStudio/workflows/emuStudio%20Build/badge.svg)

[emuStudio](https://www.net.emustudio.net/) is a desktop application used for computers emulation and writing programs
for emulated computers. It extensible - acting as a framework it encourages developers to write their own computer
emulator. It is a free software.

The main goal of emuStudio is support learning process about older but important computers, or abstract machines, and
having fun. Nowadays the ability to write programs for old computers is probably not really interesting for the programming
market, but I guess emulation has always be more about fun, trying to keeping alive something which was outstanding
in it's peak, and preserve some memories.

emuStudio is very appropriate for using at schools, e.g. when students are doing first steps in assembler, or when they
are taught about computers history. For example, emuStudio is used at [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](http://www.fei.tuke.sk/en)
since 2007.

## BIG THANKS

Big thanks goes to the one and only [simh](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/) project, which inspired me a lot, and helped
me as a student and emulator enthusiast when working on emuStudio. I wish emuStudio will reach it's simplicity and
emulators "richness" as the simh project has.

## Getting started

At first, either compile or [download](https://vbmacher.github.io/emuStudio/download/) emuStudio.
The prerequisite is to have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 installed. 

Then, unzip the zip file (`emuStudio-xxx.zip`) and run it using command:

```
java -jar emuStudio.jar
```

NOTE: Currently supported are Linux and Windows. Mac is NOT supported, but it might work to some extent.
