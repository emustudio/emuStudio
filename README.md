# Welcome to emuStudio
![emuStudio Build](https://github.com/emustudio/emuStudio/workflows/emuStudio%20Build/badge.svg)

[emuStudio](https://www.emustudio.net/) is a desktop application which allows to write programs and emulate computers.
In addition, it is easily extensible - acting as a framework it encourages developers to write their own computer
emulator. It is versatile, free, and written in Java.

The main goal is to support learning about older but important computers or abstract machines. 
It is also appropriate for using at schools; for example, emuStudio is used at
[Technical University of Ko≈°ice](http://www.fei.tuke.sk/en) since 2007.

## Related projects

There exist some additional projects, which are either incorporated in or used by emuStudio:
  
- [emuLib](https://github.com/emustudio/emuLib), a run-time library
- [edigen](https://github.com/sulir/edigen), an emulator disassembler generator


## BIG THANKS

Big thanks goes to the one and only [simh](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/) project, which inspired me a lot, and helped
me as a student and emulator enthusiast when working on emuStudio. I wish emuStudio will reach it's simplicity and
emulators "richness" as the simh project has.  

# Getting started

At first, either compile or [download](https://vbmacher.github.io/emuStudio/download/) emuStudio.
The prerequisite is to have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 installed. 

Then, unzip the zip file (`emuStudio-xxx.zip`) and run it using command:

```
java -jar emuStudio.jar
```

NOTE: Currently supported are Linux and Windows. Mac is NOT supported, but it might work to some extent.

For more information, please read [user documentation](https://vbmacher.github.io/emuStudio/docs/).
